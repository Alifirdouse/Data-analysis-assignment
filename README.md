To execute the queries successfully, ensure you have:
- A SQL database management system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- FIFA dataset imported into the database

## Instructions
1. **Database Setup:** 
   - Import the FIFA dataset into your database.
   - Ensure table structures match the queries in the script.

2. **Running the Script:**
   - Open your SQL environment.
   - Load the `Data Analysis Fifa Assignment.sql` file.
   - Execute the queries step by step to analyze the data.

## Key Analysis Areas
The script includes SQL queries covering:
- Player statistics (e.g., overall rating, potential, position-wise analysis)
- Team performances (e.g., squad value, average player ratings)
- Nationality and league-based insights
- Market value trends

## Output
Executing the queries will provide:
- Summary tables of top-performing players
- League-wise distribution of players
- Statistical insights into player attributes
- Market trends in player valuations

## Notes
